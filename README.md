# Outside Locker System

## Overview
The Safe Hold Locker System is designed to provide secure storage for personal valuables such as phones, wallets, and keys in public spaces. The system emphasizes ease of access, sanitization, and resistance to theft and mishandling, making it suitable for high-traffic areas like airports, train stations, and shopping malls. This project integrates advanced features such as RFID-based access control, stepper motor-driven locker rotation, and real-time user feedback through LEDs and LCD displays.

## Aim & Objectives
Aim
The main aim of the Safe Hold Locker System is to develop a user-friendly and secure hardware solution that ensures the safe storage of personal valuables while promoting hygiene through an integrated sanitization system.

Objectives
Design a Secure Locker System: Create a locker system that effectively protects valuables from theft or damage.
Integrate a Sanitizing System: Incorporate a hand sanitizing feature to promote hygiene and prevent the spread of germs.
Ensure User-Friendly Operation: Develop a system that is easy to use, with clear instructions for accessing and locking compartments.
Build Durability: Ensure the locker system is durable and can withstand heavy usage in high-traffic public spaces.
Conduct Rigorous Testing: Perform extensive testing to validate the system’s effectiveness in securing valuables and promoting hygiene.
Provide Customer Support: Offer efficient customer service, technical support, and maintenance post-installation.
Develop a Marketing Strategy: Promote the unique benefits of the Safe Hold Locker System to potential clients in various gathering places.
Monitor and Improve: Continuously assess the locker system’s performance and make necessary improvements.

## Solution
The proposed solution leverages sensors, motors, and RFID technology to secure valuables while ensuring ease of use and hygiene.

## Functions of the Locker System
RFID Access Control: Each user is assigned an RFID card that grants access to a specific locker compartment.
Stepper Motor Mechanism: A stepper motor, controlled by a switch, rotates the locker stand. Users can manually rotate the stand until their assigned locker faces them.
Three-Sided Locker Rotation: Users rotate the locker stand until their specific locker is aligned in front of them.
LED Indicators: Each locker compartment features red and green LEDs controlled by an IR sensor. Green indicates an empty locker, while red indicates that the locker is occupied.
Reminder Feature: The LED system also serves as a reminder if valuables have been left in the locker.
Locker Operation:
To store items: The user finds a locker with a green light, scans their RFID card, opens the locker, and places their items inside.
To retrieve items: The user locates their locker with a red light, scans their RFID card, and retrieves their belongings.
Empty Slot Counter: A seven-segment display shows the number of available (green-lit) lockers.
Security Alerts: A GSM module sends an alert sound if unauthorized access is attempted.
LCD Display: Provides user feedback and instructions. Displays messages like "WELCOME, ENTER CARD", "LOCKER (LOCKER NO) UNLOCKED", or "WRONG CARD" based on user actions.

## Installation
To set up the Safe Hold Locker System, follow these steps:


## Install Required Hardware Components:

RFID Reader and Cards
Stepper Motor and Driver
IR Sensors and LEDs
GSM Module
LCD Display
Seven-Segment Display


## Usage
Scan the RFID Card: To open or close a locker, scan the RFID card assigned to your locker.
Rotate the Locker Stand: Use the switch to rotate the locker stand until your locker compartment is in front of you.
Check LED Indicators: Look for a green light (empty locker) or red light (occupied locker) before using the locker.
Sanitize Your Hands: Use the built-in sanitizing unit to clean your hands before and after using the locker.
Follow LCD Instructions: Pay attention to messages displayed on the LCD for guidance and system status.

## Testing
Functionality Test: Test each feature (RFID scanning, locker rotation, LED indicators, etc.) to ensure they work as expected.
Security Test: Simulate unauthorized access to verify that the GSM module correctly triggers an alert.
Durability Test: Simulate heavy usage to test the durability of the locker system.
Sanitization Test: Ensure the sanitizing unit effectively dispenses sanitizer and promotes hygiene.
